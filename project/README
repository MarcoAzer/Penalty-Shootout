# Objectives
     1. Modelling a scene
     2. User Interface --- use arrow keys to aim the ball, space bar to shoot the ball and UI to control initial speed, wind and lighting
     3. Texture mapping --- flags of countries playing and score
     4. Bump mapping --- soccer field and brick wall
     5. Animation --- using key frame and Linear Spline Interpolation. Goalie is moving his arms and legs to save the ball
     6. Synchronized sound --- when ball is "kicked", hit goalie and net, went into net, and fly away
     7. Static collision --- collision with post or static goalie
     8. Dynamic collision --- collision with a moving goalie
     9. Physics engine --- for the projectile motion of the ball. The physics variables are Initial speed, initial direction, gravity, and wind vector.
     10. Reflector map --- Skybox
